# One-Year DSA Roadmap for Product-Based Companies

**Target Companies:** Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Uber, Atlassian  
**Duration:** 12 Months  
**Language:** Python (recommended) / Java  
**Daily Commitment:** 2–4 hours  
**Goal:** Interview-ready problem solver with strong fundamentals and pattern recognition

---

## Core Principles

- Focus on **patterns, not problems**
- Revise aggressively; repetition builds speed
- Optimize for **clarity + correctness**, not clever code
- Always reason about **time and space complexity**
- Solve fewer problems well rather than many poorly

---

## Daily Workflow

### Weekdays (2–3 hrs)
- 20 min → Learn concept/pattern
- 90 min → Solve 2–3 problems
- 20 min → Revise old problems
- 10 min → Write notes (mistakes, patterns)

### Weekends (4–6 hrs)
- 6–8 problems
- 1 mock interview or timed set
- Weekly revision

---

- Mock interviews (3–4 per week)
- Verbal explanation practice
- Resume alignment with projects

### Tasks
- Re-solve top 150 problems
- Explain trade-offs clearly
- Handle follow-up constraints

---

## Final 60-Day Sprint

- No new topics
- Redo previously solved problems
- Focus areas:
  - Arrays
  - Trees
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Graphs
- Write solutions without reference
- Prioritize correctness + clarity

---

## Evaluation Checklist (Interview Ready)

- Can solve medium problems in <35 minutes
- Can explain approach clearly
- Can derive optimal complexity
- Can debug calmly
- Recognize patterns instantly

---

## Platforms

- LeetCode (Primary)
- GeeksForGeeks (Concepts)
- InterviewBit (Revision)
- Pramp / Interviewing.io (Mocks)

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Skipping revision
- Memorizing solutions
- Watching too many tutorials
- Switching languages
- Ignoring explanation practice

---

## Final Note

Consistency beats intensity.  
Solve thoughtfully. Revise relentlessly.  
Interviews reward **thinking, not memorization**.
