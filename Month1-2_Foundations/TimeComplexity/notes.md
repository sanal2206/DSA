# Time & Space Complexity

## Key Concepts
- Big O notation
- Time complexity analysis
- Space complexity analysis
- Common complexities: O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2), etc.

## Patterns
- Analyze loops
- Recursive complexity
- Amortized analysis

## Canonical Problems
- None specific, but practice analyzing complexity in all problems
